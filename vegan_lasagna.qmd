### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Prepare the Rich Marinara Sauce
1.  Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
2.  Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3.  Stir in the crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes (with their liquid), vegetable broth, basil, oregano, and sugar.
4.  Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it gently simmer for at least 30-40 minutes (the longer, the better the flavor), stirring occasionally. Season generously with salt and pepper to taste.

#### 2. Make the Creamy Tofu "Ricotta"
1.  While the sauce simmers, crumble the pressed tofu into a food processor.
2.  Add the nutritional yeast, lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, onion powder, dried basil, salt, and pepper.
3.  Process until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary. Set aside.

#### 3. Sauté the Spinach & Mushroom Filling
1.  Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
2.  Add the sliced mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they release their liquid and start to brown, about 8-10 minutes.
3.  Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
4.  Add the fresh spinach in batches if necessary, stirring until it wilts down completely. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.

#### 4. Assemble the Lasagna
1.  Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2.  Spread about 1 cup of the marinara sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
3.  Arrange a single layer of no-boil lasagna noodles over the sauce (usually 3-4 noodles, depending on width). Don't overlap too much.
4.  Spread half of the tofu "ricotta" evenly over the noodles.
5.  Top with half of the spinach and mushroom filling.
6.  Spoon about 1.5 cups of marinara sauce over the filling.
7.  Repeat the layers: noodles, remaining tofu "ricotta," remaining spinach and mushroom filling, and another 1.5 cups of marinara sauce.
8.  Place a final layer of noodles on top, then cover generously with the remaining marinara sauce.
9.  If using, sprinkle the vegan shredded mozzarella over the top.

#### 5. Bake the Lasagna
1.  Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.
2.  Bake for 35-40 minutes.
3.  Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and lightly browned (and the vegan cheese, if used, is melted).

#### 6. Rest and Serve
1.  This is crucial for lasagna! Let the lasagna rest on a wire rack for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and prevents it from falling apart.
2.  Garnish with fresh basil leaves. Enjoy!

### Chef's Notes

*   **Make Ahead:** Lasagna is a fantastic make-ahead meal! You can assemble it a day in advance, cover it tightly, and refrigerate. Add an extra 10-15 minutes to the covered baking time if baking from cold.
*   **Spice it Up:** For a spicier kick, increase the red pepper flakes in the marinara sauce.
*   **Herb Power:** Don't be shy with fresh herbs! A sprinkle of fresh parsley or oregano over the top before serving adds brightness.
*   **Gluten-Free:** Use gluten-free no-boil lasagna noodles to make this recipe celiac-friendly.
*   **Batch Cooking:** This recipe makes a generous amount, perfect for meal prepping or freezing individual portions for quick meals later.
